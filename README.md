The following code is a text based replication of Twitter. The program will allow users to do the following:
- Create accounts
- Sign in/out
- Create hoots (tweets, posts, messages, etc)
- Make hoots public or private
- Subscribe to another user to see their private posts
- Search by phrase or hashtags
- View all public hoots, subscriber hoots, and any public hoots that mention you (using the @youraccountname tag)
